# Starter TS Module

This is my personal starter setup for creating TypeScript modules.

## Getting started

To get started just copy this repo, then run `npm install` and `npx @grantcodes/commit install` to install git hooks.

## What's in the box?

- [@grantcodes/commit](https://github.com/grantcodes/commit) to handle commit messages
- [tsup](https://github.com/egoist/tsup) for TypeScript building
- [Node.js test runner](https://nodejs.org/api/test.html) for testing
- [Biome](https://biomejs.dev) for formatting
