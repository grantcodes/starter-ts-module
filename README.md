# Starter TS Module

This is my personal starter setup for creating TypeScript modules.

## Getting started

To get started just copy this repo, then run `npm install` and `npx @grantcodes/commit install` to install git hooks.

## What's in the box?

- [@grantcodes/commit](https://github.com/grantcodes/commit) to handle commit messages
- [tsup](https://github.com/egoist/tsup) for TypeScript building
- [ava](https://github.com/avajs/ava) for testing
- [standard](https://github.com/standard/ts-standard) for formatting
